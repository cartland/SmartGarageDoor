# Pending Smoke Tests

User-facing changes that have shipped to the **internal Play Store track** but not yet been smoke-tested on a real device. Each item is one cohesive scenario to verify on hardware.

**Scope of this list:** Android-only. Server-side changes that ride along with an Android release (e.g. server pubsub cadence) are noted on the Android item that depends on them.

**Workflow:**

1. When a release ships to internal track, append a row here with the version, the scenario to verify, and a short reproduction.
2. When the user smoke-tests the device, they (or the agent on request) checks items off and removes them from this list.
3. If a smoke test fails, file a GitHub issue and reference it here; remove from this list once the issue is filed (don't dual-track).
4. Items roll up by user-facing version, not by every patch — if 2.16.10 and 2.16.11 ship two versions of the same scenario, list the latest one with a note covering both.

**Why this lives in the repo, not memory:** the smoke queue is project-specific TODO state. Agents should not write it to memory (see `feedback_dump_context_repo_first.md`); the user maintains it across sessions and across machines.

## Cumulative queue

> **Empty.** Last cleared 2026-05-12: `android/240` (nav-rail consolidated bottom sheet) and `android/241` (`:viewmodel` module extraction) smoke-tested on device. Add new entries here as releases ship to internal track.

## Open follow-ups (release-related but not smoke-test items)

> **None.** Feature follow-ups live in [`PENDING_FOLLOWUPS.md`](./PENDING_FOLLOWUPS.md). The Play Store whatsnew file is rolling and refreshed by the `bump-android-version` skill on every minor/major — staleness during a patch series is expected and self-resolves on the next minor.
